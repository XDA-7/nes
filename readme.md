# National Economy Simulator
A project written mainly to practice C++ as well as try out some of the capabilities of QT

# Gameplay
The mechanics of the simulation are fairly simple.
- Buildings can be constructed with capital goods, which can be stockpiled(all other goods cant), and undeveloped land
- Production in an industry is the product of the number of workers in the industry and productivity
- Productivity increases with the amount of capital investment per worker but with diminishing returns
- Industrial output is also limited by the availability of the natural resources wood, iron and oil
- Industrial output is split between the production of capital goods and consumer goods
- The amount of agricultural and consumer goods available per person currently has no effect, but try to get it as high as you can anyway
- Resources can be traded at fixed prices for gold on the international market
